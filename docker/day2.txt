1- Build time:

- The image is created (docker build)Instructions in the Dockerfile are executed Layers are created
- Build time is when the image is constructed


2 - Runtime:
- The image is run as a container (docker run)The container is executed from the final image layers Port mappings,
- volume mounts etc take effect The actual process inside the container is executed
- Runtime is when the image (as a container) is executed



3- NetWork in Docker 

$ docker network create net-name : to create a network 


$ docker network ls 
 
$ docker network connect net-name contr-name

$ docker network disconnect net-name contr-name

$ docker network create --subnet 16.0.0.4/16 

$ docker network create --internal net-name 











4- Volumes

-  Create a volume: 
$docker volume create my-vol
- List volumes:
$ docker volume ls
- Inspect a volume: 
$ docker volume inspect my-vol
- Remove a volume:
$  docker volume rm my-vol

Volume usage with containers:

- Mount a volume: 
$docker run -v my-vol:/app image-name
- Mount a host directory as a volume:
 $ docker run -v /host/dir:/app image-name
- Mount a volume read-only: 
$ docker run -v my-vol:/app:ro image-name


- docker volume prune:
$ Deletes all unused volumes in Docker.

- Mounts a host directory as a volume in a container.

$ docker run -v [HOST_DIRECTORY]:[CONTAINER_DIRECTORY] [IMAGE_NAME]:
- Mounts a host directory as a volume in a container.

$ docker run -v [VOLUME_NAME]:[CONTAINER_DIRECTORY] [IMAGE_NAME]: 
Mounts a Docker volume as a volume in a container.

to create an image by container :
$ docker commit  image:name  conr-name



$ docker build -t myapp .
- to build docker file
