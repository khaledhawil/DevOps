- Container orchestration:
Kubernetes is a tool that automates the deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes,
abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.


- Cluster:
 Kubernetes runs on a cluster of nodes, which can be physical or virtual machines,
that are grouped together to form a pool of resources for running containers.


- Pod: 
A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes,
consisting of one or more containers that share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other directly.

- Service:
 A service is an abstraction that defines a set of pods and a policy for accessing them,
providing a stable IP address and DNS name for the pods, and load-balancing traffic between them.


- Deployment:
 A deployment is a higher-level abstraction that defines a desired state for a set of replicas of a pod or a container,
allowing Kubernetes to automatically create, scale, and update them as needed.



- Configuration:
 Kubernetes uses configuration files, such as YAML or JSON files, to define the desired state of the cluster,
  including the resources, services, deployments, and other objects.



 - API:
   Kubernetes exposes a RESTful API that allows users to interact with the cluster programmatically, using tools such as kubectl,
    the Kubernetes command-line interface.
