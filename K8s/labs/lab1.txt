1- Create a  pod with the name redis and with the image redis.
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: redis
# spec:
#   containers:
#   - name: redis
#     image: redis
# another solution # 
$ kubectl run  pod --image=redis redis


2- Create a  pod with the name nginx and with the image “nginx123”
Use a pod-definition YAML file.

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: "nginx"
# spec:
#   containers:
#   - name: nginx
#     image: "nginx123"
# and 
$ kubectl  apply -f nginx.yml 


3- What is the nginx pod status?
$ kubectl get pod nginx
# NAME    READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
# nginx   0/1     ErrImagePull   0          70s

5- Change the nginx pod image to “nginx” 

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: "nginx"
# spec:
#   containers:
#   - name: nginx
#     image: "nginx"
- check the status again:
$ kubectl get pod nginx
# NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# nginx   1/1     Running   0          63s


6- How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
$ kubectl get rs

^output
# No resources found in default namespace.

7- create a ReplicaSet with
name= replica-set-1
image= busybox
replicas= 3

# replica.yml  file in this directory 
$ kubectl apply  -f replica.yml

8- Scale the ReplicaSet replica-set-1 to 5 PODs.
- there are a couple of ways 
$ kubectl scale rs replica-set-1 --replicas=5

- and the second :
   edit on replica.yml file and replace 3 with 5 


9- How many PODs are READY in the replica-set-1?

$ kubectl get pods -l test="busybox" # seearch with label name
there no pods ready 

10- Delete any one of the 5 PODs then check How many PODs exist now?
$ kubectl delete po replica-set-1-k9fp4   
still 5  pods 

- Why are there still 5 PODs, even after you deleted one?
the ReplicaSet will automatically create a new pod 
to maintain the desired number of replicas,
unless the number of desired replicas has been manually decreased.

11- How many Deployments and ReplicaSets exist on the system?

$ kubectl get all

there are no Deployments
and there is one ReplicaSet

12- create a Deployment with
name= deployment-1
image= busybox
replicas= 3

14- How many pods are ready with the deployment-1?
# 3

15- Update deployment-1 image to nginx then check the ready pods again
