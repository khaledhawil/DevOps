- ======================================= NameSpace =================================================================================
In Kubernetes, a namespace is a way to partition resources into logically named groups. 
Namespaces provide a way to organize and scope resources in a cluster, 
making it easier to manage and maintain large and complex applications.


Each Kubernetes object belongs to a specific namespace, 
and no two objects can have the same name within the same namespace. 
This means that you can have multiple resources with the same name as long as they are in different namespaces.

# Namespaces are a powerful tool for organizing and managing resources in a Kubernetes cluster. 
# By using them effectively, you can improve the security, reliability, and scalability of your applications


- ===================================== How to use it ================================================================


- To create a new namespace called my-namespace, run the following command:

$ kubectl create namespace my-namespace


- To list all the namespaces in your cluster, run the following command:

$ kubectl get namespaces

- To switch to a specific namespace, run the following command:

$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace

- To deploy an application in a specific namespace, you can include the namespace parameter in your kubectl apply command:

$ kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml --namespace=my-namespace
