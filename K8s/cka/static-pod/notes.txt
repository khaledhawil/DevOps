# =-------------------------------------------------- Static Pod ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A static pod in Kubernetes is a pod that is created and managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node. 
Unlike regular pods, which are managed by the Kubernetes control plane and scheduled on any available node in the cluster,
static pods are bound to a specific node and are not managed by the control plane.
- ----------------------

Static pods can be useful for running system-level components or for bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster before the control plane is up and running. 
They are created and managed by the kubelet using YAML manifests stored on the node's file system.


To create a static pod, 
you simply create a YAML manifest file describing the pod and save it to the appropriate directory on the node's file system.
 By default, the kubelet looks for static pod manifests in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.

Here's an example YAML manifest for a simple nginx static pod: # the file named nginx.yaml
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: nginx
# spec:
#   containers:
#   - name: nginx
#     image: nginx:latest
#     ports:
#     - containerPort: 80

To create the static pod, save this YAML manifest to /etc/kubernetes/manifests/nginx.yaml on the node where you want to run it. 
The kubelet will automatically detect the manifest file and create the pod.


$ kubectl run --restart=Never --image=busybox static-busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/static-busybox.yaml
