In Kubernetes, 
a service is an abstraction layer that provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods running the same application or microservice. 
Services in Kubernetes provide a way to expose applications running in a Kubernetes cluster to other parts of the system or external clients.


Services in Kubernetes also provide load balancing capabilities. 
When a client sends a request to a service, the service automatically distributes the request to one of the available pods running the application. 
This allows multiple pods to serve incoming requests, providing high availability and improved performance.

- ============================================ types of services ======================================================================================


- ClusterIP: 
The ClusterIP service type is the default type and provides internal access to the service within the cluster. 
The service is given a virtual IP address (ClusterIP) that is used by other services within the cluster to communicate with it.



- NodePort: 
The NodePort service type provides external access to the service by exposing a static port on each node in the cluster. 
Traffic to this port is forwarded to the service's ClusterIP.


- LoadBalancer: 
The LoadBalancer service type provides external access to the service by provisioning a cloud provider's load balancer. 
This is typically used for services that need to be accessed from outside the cluster.




# Some questions 
- What is a Kubernetes service and why is it used?

It allows clients to access the pods without needing to know their individual IP addresses.

- How do you create a Kubernetes service using the command line interface (CLI)?

k expose deploy dep-name --name service-name --type NodePort  --port 80 --target-port 80 

- What is the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer service types in Kubernetes?

- ClusterIP:
this to communicate pods inside  the k8s cluster 

- NodePort:
it allows to access the pod from outside


- LoadBalancer :

This type of service creates a load balancer in the cloud provider's infrastructure
