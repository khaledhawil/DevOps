# =------------------------------------------------- Daemon Set ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A DaemonSet in Kubernetes is a type of controller that ensures that a copy of a specific pod is running on every node in a cluster. 
This is useful for running system-level daemons or other workloads that should run on every node in the cluster


When you create a DaemonSet, a pod is automatically created on each node in the cluster that matches the specified node selector. 
The DaemonSet controller monitors the nodes in the cluster and automatically creates or deletes pods as nodes are added or removed.


DaemonSets are commonly used for tasks such as logging, monitoring, or networking. 
For example, you might use a DaemonSet to run a logging agent on each node in the cluster, 
so that you can collect logs from all of the nodes in a centralized location.

Here's an example YAML manifest for a simple DaemonSet that runs an nginx web server on each node in the cluster:
# apiVersion: apps/v1
# kind: DaemonSet
# metadata:
#   name: nginx
# spec:
#   selector:
#     matchLabels:
#       app: nginx
#   template:
#     metadata:
#       labels:
#         app: nginx
#     spec:
#       containers:
#       - name: nginx
#         image: nginx:latest
#         ports:
#         - containerPort: 80


- In this example, 
the DaemonSet controller will ensure that a pod running the nginx container is created on every node in the cluster that has a label of app=nginx.
