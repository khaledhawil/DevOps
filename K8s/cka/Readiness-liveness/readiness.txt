#  ============================================ Readiness and Liveness Probes ============================================================================

readiness and liveness probes are used to ensure the health and availability of containerized applications running within the Kubernetes cluster.



- Readiness
A readiness probe is used to indicate whether a pod is ready to start accepting traffic. 
Kubernetes sends periodic readiness probes to the container to check if it is ready to accept requests. 
If the container fails the readiness probe, Kubernetes will remove the pod from service until the container passes the probe,
 preventing any traffic from being sent to the container until it is ready to handle it.


 containers:
 - name: my-container
   image: khaledhawil/pyapp
   ports:
   - containerPort: 8080
   readinessProbe:
     httpGet:
       path: /healthz
       port: 8080
     initialDelaySeconds: 5
     periodSeconds: 10


$ k logs  my-app-695ff8c478-7xtzb -c my-container




- Liveness
A liveness probe is used to check if the container is still running and responding to requests. 
Kubernetes sends periodic liveness probes to the container to check if it is still running and responding as expected. 
If the container fails the liveness probe, Kubernetes will assume that the container is not functioning correctly and will terminate it,
 triggering a restart of the container
 

 livenessProbe:
 httpGet:
   path: /healthz
   port: 8080
