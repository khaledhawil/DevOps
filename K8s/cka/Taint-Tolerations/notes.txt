* Here w'll Taka About Taint And Tolerations 



"Taints and Tolerations" :
that allows users to set specific requirements for running applications on a particular node in a Kubernetes cluster. 
This system works by labeling the desired node with a "taint" and setting a "toleration" on the applications that you want to run on that node.

# Essentially, 
-  when you add a taint to a node in Kubernetes, you are declaring that this node has special requirements that make it unavailable to all applications. 
# For example, it may have specific security requirements, or it may have specific requirements for memory or processing power.

- When you add a toleration to a Kubernetes application, you are declaring that the application can tolerate the matching taint on the node. 
# In this way, you can ensure that only the applications that need to meet specific requirements run on the appropriate node.


"In general"
Taints and Tolerations in Kubernetes are used to provide an extra level of security and flexibility to your applications. 
You can use this feature to ensure that your applications run only on the appropriate node, protect your Kubernetes nodes from overload, 
and provide you with the ability to provide specialized capabilities to the applications that need them.


- ------------------------------------------------------- How To Use Them? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Taint
Taint the node(s) with the required label(s): 
Use the kubectl taint command to add a taint to the node(s) with the required label(s). 
For example, to add a taint to a node with label "specialnode", use the following command:

$ kubectl taint nodes specialnode key=value:taint-effect

Here "key=value" : 
is a key-value pair for the taint, 
and "taint-effect" can be "NoSchedule", "PreferNoSchedule", or "NoExecute".
# Taint-Effects:
- NoSchedule:
This effect means that no new pods will be scheduled on a node that has the taint, 
unless the pod has a matching toleration. 
Pods that are already running on the node will continue to run.

- PreferNoSchedule 
This effect means that the Kubernetes scheduler will try to avoid scheduling new pods on a node that has the taint, 
but it is not a hard requirement. 
Pods that are already running on the node will continue to run
 
- NoExecute
This effect means that any pods that are not tolerated by the taint will be evicted from the node. 
This can happen if the pod is already running on the node when the taint is applied, 
or if the pod is scheduled on the node after the taint is applied.
# ------------------------------------------- NoSchedule Vs NoExecute --------------------------------------------------------
In summary: 

# NoSchedule :

in that it only prevents new pods from being scheduled on the node, 
- while existing pods are allowed to continue running. 

# NoExecute, 
on the other hand, 
- is a more strict form of taint that will remove existing pods that do not tolerate the taint



#Toleration
- Add a toleration to the pod: 
Use the tolerations field in the pod's YAML file to specify the toleration for the matching taint on the node. 
For example, to add a toleration to a pod that matches the taint added in step 1, use the following YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"  
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"  # Here, "key", "value", and "effect" should match the taint added in step 1.




- Deploy the pod to the node: 

Use the kubectl apply command to deploy the pod to the node with the matching taint and toleration. 
For example, to deploy the pod "my-pod" to the node with the taint "specialnode", use the following command:

$ kubectl apply -f my-pod.yaml --node-selector='specialnode=true'



Here, "my-pod.yaml" is the YAML file with the pod configuration, and "--node-selector" selects the node with the label "specialnode".

That's it! 
Now, the pod will be scheduled to run only on the node(s) that match the taint and toleration.
