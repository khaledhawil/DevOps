- How many nodes exist on the system?
$ k get pods 
output:
# No resources found in default namespace.

- Do any taints exist on node01 node? # node01 = minikube
$ kubectl describe node minikube  | grep -i taint 
output:
# Taints:             <none>

- Create a taint on node01 with key of spray, value of mortein and effect of NoSchedule
$ kubectl taint node minikube spray=mortein:NoSchedule
output:
# node/minikube tainted

- Create a new pod with the nginx image and pod name as mosquito.
$ kubectl run mosquito --image=nginx 
output:
# pod/mosquito created

- What is the state of the POD?
$ kubectl get po 
output:  # tha state is pending 
# NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# mosquito   0/1     Pending   0          52s


- Why do you think the pod is in a pending state?
the pod cannot tolerate the taint on the node.


- Create another pod named bee with the nginx image, which has a toleration set to the taint mortein

in taint.yml file 
$ kubectl create -f taint.yml
output:
#pod/myapp-pod created
 

- Do you see any taints on minikube node?
$ kubectl describe node minikube | grep Taint
output:
# Taints:             spray=mortein:NoSchedule

- Remove the taint on minikube, which currently has the taint effect of NoSchedule.
$ kubectl taint node minikube spray- 
output:
# node/minikube untainted

- What is the state of the pod mosquito now?
$ kubectl  get po
output: is running now after remove the taint 
# mosquito    1/1     Running   0          9m14s


- Which node is the POD mosquito on now?
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
output:
# mosquito    1/1     Running   0          10m     10.244.0.46   minikube   <none>           <none>









# - Create a taint on  node node01 with key app with value critical and effect of NoSchedule


# kk taint node node01 app=critical:NoSchedule
