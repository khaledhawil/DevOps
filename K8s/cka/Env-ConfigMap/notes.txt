- Environment variables are a way to pass configuration information to a container, such as database connection settings or API keys. 
By using environment variables, 
you can decouple your application code from its configuration, which makes it easier to deploy your application across multiple environments.



For example, to set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to postgres://user:password@host:port/database in a container, 
you would define the container specification like this:

containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    env:
      - name: DATABASE_URL
        value: postgres://user:password@host:port/database
