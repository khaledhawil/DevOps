- -------------------------------------------------- Node Affinity ----------------------------------------------------------------------

that allows you to specify more complex rules for pod scheduling than just using node selectors. 
With node affinity, 
you can define rules based on the labels of a node or the labels of other pods running on a node.

- There are two types of node affinity in Kubernetes:

1- RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
This means that the pod must be scheduled on a node that matches the node affinity rules. 
If no nodes match the rules, the pod will not be scheduled.


2- PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
This means that the pod should be scheduled on a node that matches the node affinity rules, 
but if no such node is available, the pod can still be scheduled on a node that doesn't match the rules.


Here's an example:

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: my-pod
# spec:
#   containers:
#   - name: my-container
#     image: my-image
#   nodeAffinity:
#     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
#       nodeSelectorTerms:
#       - matchExpressions:
#         - key: disktype
#           operator: In
#           values:
#           - ssd
