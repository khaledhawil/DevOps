An Ingress controller is a component in Kubernetes that manages external access to services within a cluster. It acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, routing incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on rules defined in the Ingress resource.

In summary, an Ingress controller is a component in Kubernetes that acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, routing incoming traffic to the appropriate services based on rules defined in the Ingress resource. 
While an Ingress controller implements the Ingress resource and handles traffic routing, it is not the same as a standalone reverse proxy. The Ingress controller works in conjunction with the Ingress resource to provide a simplified and automated way of configuring traffic routing in a Kubernetes cluster.
