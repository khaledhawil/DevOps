- In Kubernetes, 
API groups are a way to organize and categorize related resources within the Kubernetes API. 
The Kubernetes API is designed to be extensible, allowing different components and plugins to introduce their own resources and functionality.

API groups provide a mechanism to group related resources under a common prefix within the API. 
Each API group typically represents a specific feature or subsystem within Kubernetes. 
By organizing resources into API groups, it becomes easier to manage and maintain a large number of resources and prevents naming conflicts.
