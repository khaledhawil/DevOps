- Check number of replica sets in the default namespace

$ k get rs

- Create a replica set named replica-set-demo using a pod named ngnix using a nginx image and labeled as tier=frontend with a single replica.

# apiVersion: app/v1
# kind: ReplicaSet
# metadata:
#    name: replica-set-demo
# spec:
#   replicas: 1
#   selector:
#     matchLabels:
#       tair: frontend
#   template:
#     metadate:
#        labels:
#            tier: frontend
#     spec:
#       containers:            
#         - name : nginx
#           image: nginx


- Scale up the replica-set-demo from 1 replica to 2 replicas

$ kubectl scale --replicas=2 replicaset.apps/replica-set-demo
$ kubectl scale --replicas=2 rs replica-set-demo
# you can edit in file and run apply command

- Scale up the replica-set-demo from 2 replicas to 1 replica
$ kubectl scale --replicas=1 rs replica-set-demo

- Create a replica set using the below definition and fix any issues.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx

# Check the apiVersion using kubectl explain replicasets which is apps/v
Update the version and apply again.


- Create a replica set using the below definition and fix any issues.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx

# The replica set selector field tier: frontend does not match the pod labels tier: nginx. Correct either of them and reapply






Clean up

kubectl delete replicaset replica-set-demo replicaset-1 replicaset-2
rm replica-set-demo.yaml











- How many pods exist on the system?
$ k get po 
- How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
$ k get rs

- How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?
$ kubectl get replicasets # there is no rs

- How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-se
