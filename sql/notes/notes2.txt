* let's talk about date and time .... :

1- DATE data type: Stores only the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Example: '2023-04-04'
> CURRENT_DATE();

2- TIME data type: Stores only the time in HH:MM:SS format.

> CURRENT_TIME() ;

3-DATETIME data type: Stores both date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

> SELECT CURRENT_DATE() as Today , DAYNAME(CURRENT_DATE) as DayName ;
+------------+---------+
