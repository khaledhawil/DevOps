-  rm stands for "remove". It is used to remove files and directories. The rm command can delete a single file, multiple files, or an entire directory and its contents recursively. It is a powerful command that can permanently delete files without confirmation
- rmdir stands for "remove directory".
 It is used to remove empty directories.
  The rmdir command can only delete empty directories, meaning directories that do not contain any files or subdirectories. If a directory contains files or subdirectories, rmdir will not delete it and will give an error message.
