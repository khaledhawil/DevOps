     #SUID :
     When this permission is set on an executable file, it allows users who execute the file to run it with the privileges of the file owner instead of their own privileges. This is useful for allowing non-privileged users to execute programs that require higher privileges.
     #SGID :
     When this permission is set on a directory, it allows files created in the directory to inherit the group ownership of the directory instead of the group ownership of the user who created the file.
     #Sticky bit:
     When this permission is set on a directory, it prevents users from deleting or renaming files that are owned by other users. It is commonly used on directories that are shared by multiple users to prevent accidental deletion of files.
