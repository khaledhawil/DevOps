- The nslookup command:
 is a network diagnostic tool used to query the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain information about domain names or IP addresses. 
It is commonly used to perform DNS lookups and resolve hostnames to IP addresses, or vice versa.
The basic syntax of the nslookup command is as follows:

$ nslookup [options] [hostname or IP address] [DNS server]

Here are some common usages of the nslookup command:

$ nslookup example.com

Perform a reverse DNS lookup (resolve an IP address to a hostname):

$ nslookup 192.0.2.1

Specify a specific DNS server to query:

$ nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8

Get more detailed information (including the DNS server used, query type, and response time:

$ nslookup -debug example.com



- ping:
Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a specified IP address or hostname to check network connectivity and measure round-trip time.

$ ping example.com

- traceroute:
 (or tracert on Windows): Displays the route and measures the round-trip time for packets sent from your device to a destination IP address or hostname, showing each intermediate hop.

$ traceroute example.com
 








Explore tools like curl, nslookup, netcat, and traceroute to diagnose network-related issues within your pods. These tools can help you troubleshoot connectivity problems.
