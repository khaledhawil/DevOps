* here i'll talk about Vagrant:


1- What is a Vagrant ? 
is an open-source tool for building and managing virtual machine environments.
It allows developers to easily create, configure,and share development environments
that are consistent across different machines, operating systems, and teams.

$ cd folder-name
$ touch Vagrantfile or $ vagrant init image-name
